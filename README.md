1. Problem1: Develop a calculator using switch case
Get two numbers of a type of integer or double from the user and perform the
operation(Add, Multiply, Divide, Subtract) selected by the user using switch case, if-else
statement, break and looping switch case using recursion
2. Problem2: ​ Given four integers sort them in ascending order using if-else statement
3. Problem3: ​ Given a sorted array of positive integers, rearrange the array alternately i.e first
element should be a maximum value, second minimum value, third-second max,
fourth-second min and so on
4. Problem4: ​ Find whether the given number is a Strong Number or not. Strong Numbers
are the numbers whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the original number.
5. Problem 5: ​ Finding the sum of common elements from given two arrays.
6. Problem 6: ​ Given a positive number, find the length of the longest sequence of zeros in
the binary representation of a positive integer Conditional statements and loops
7. Problem 7: ​ Write a program, which reads a number of students and n grades as input (of
int between 0 and 100, inclusive) and displays the average, minimum, and maximum. Your
program shall check for valid input. You should keep all the grades in an int[] and use a
method for each of the computations.
Output:
Enter the number of students: 4
Enter the grade for student 1: 86
Enter the grade for student 2: 65
Enter the grade for student 3: 98
Enter the grade for student 4: 77
The average is 81.50The minimum is 65
The maximum is 98
8. Problem 8: ​ Write a program to print the following :
		*
	   **
	  ***
	 ****
	*****
18. Program 9: ​ Given an array of ints, return the number of 9's in the array.
arrayCount9([1, 2, 9]) → 1
arrayCount9([1, 9, 9]) → 2
arrayCount9([1, 9, 9, 3, 9]) → 3
10. Program 10: ​ Write a program that accepts a number as input and check whether the
given number is palindrome or not If it is a palindrome then
a. Add all the even numbers and check whether the sum is more than 25.
b. Print success and failure messages for all 3 conditions
Input: 2468642
Output: 2468642 is a palindrome and the sum of even numbers is greater than 25
Input: 12345
Output: 12345 is not a palindrome
Input: 12345654321
Output: 12345654321 is a palindrome and the sum of even numbers is less than 25
Program 11: ​ Write a program which accepts an integer number as input from the user
and perform the following conditional checks:
a. Print Tom if the number is odd and exists between 20 to 30
b. Print Jerry, if the number is even and exists between 20 and 30Program 12:​ Write a program using a loop to print the following output. 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6
6 6 . . . nth iteration.
Input: 5
Output : 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5
